# Risk filter suite tool

The [World Wildlife Fund (WWF)](https://www.worldwildlife.org/about/) has created the [Risk Filter Suite](http://www.riskfilter.org/) to enable companies and investors to “assess and respond to nature-related risks to strengthen resilience”. Their data was derived from [ENCOREs](https://encore.naturalcapital.finance/en) direct natural capital risk evaluation and the [SBTN Sectoral Materiality Tool for Step 1a](https://sciencebasedtargetsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Science-Based-Targets-for-Nature-Initial-Guidance-for-Business.pdf).

This project involves (1) Retrieval of biodiversity risk data from the colored map Leaflets on riskfilter.org, and (2) tools to evaluate the risk at geographic locations and in geographic regions.

An example of the usage of this tool is given in the Jupyter notebook `riskbook.ipynb`, which can alternatively be viewer [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/monochromatti/biodiversity_risk/blob/main/riskbook.ipynb).
