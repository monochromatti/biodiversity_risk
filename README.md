# biodiversity_risk

The ![https://www.worldwildlife.org/about/](World Wildlife Fund (WWF)) has created the ![Risk Filter Suite](http://www.riskfilter.org/) to enable companies and investors to “assess and respond to nature-related risks to strengthen resilience”. Their data was derived from ![ENCOREs](https://encore.naturalcapital.finance/en) direct natural capital risk evaluation and the ![SBTN Sectoral Materiality Tool for Step 1a](https://sciencebasedtargetsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Science-Based-Targets-for-Nature-Initial-Guidance-for-Business.pdf).

This project involves (1) Extraction of biodiversity risk data from the Leaflets on riskfilter.org, and (2) tools to evaluate the risk at geographic locations.
